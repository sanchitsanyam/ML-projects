# Predicting Olympic Medals


This project aims predict the number of medals a country will win in the Olympics using historical and current data from the data set [`teams.csv`](https://github.com/sanchitsanyam/ML-projects/blob/main/teams%20(1).csv): using machine learning algorithms

## Project Steps
The project follows these steps:

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
To set up the project locally, install the following Python packages:







## Usage

### Running the Project
1. Open `data_prep.ipynb` and run all cells to generate the team-level dataset.
2. Open `machine_learning.ipynb` and follow the steps to build and evaluate the model.

Certainly! Here is the entire approach in passive voice and written as if it has been completed:

### Hypothesis
- It was hypothesized that the number of medals won by a country could be predicted using historical and socio-economic data.

### Data Exploration and Preparation
1. **Data Exploration**
   - The dataset was loaded, and its structure, including the number of rows and columns, was examined.
   - Key variables related to historical and socio-economic data were identified.
   - Summary statistics were generated to understand the distribution of these variables.

2. **Data Reshaping**
   - Athlete-level data was converted into a team-level dataset.
   - Data was aggregated to the country level, with relevant metrics summed or averaged as appropriate.

### Data Cleaning
1. **Missing Values Handling**
   - Missing values in the dataset were identified.
   - Appropriate strategies were used to handle missing data, such as imputation or removal of rows/columns with significant missing data.

2. **Data Normalization or Standardization**
   - The need for normalization or standardization was assessed.
   - Normalization or standardization techniques were applied to ensure the data was on a comparable scale.

### Model Training
1. **Data Splitting**
   - The dataset was divided into training and test sets, typically using an 80-20 or 70-30 split.
   - The split maintained the representativeness of the data.

2. **Model Training**
   - A machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree) was chosen.
   - The chosen model was trained on the training set using relevant features.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - An appropriate error metric was used to evaluate the model’s performance (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error).
   - The model’s predictions on the test set were compared against the actual values to assess accuracy.

By following these steps systematically, a robust predictive model for the number of medals won by countries based on historical and socio-economic factors was built.
