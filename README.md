# Predicting Olympic Medals: A Beginner Machine Learning Project


This project aims predict the number of medals a country will win in the Olympics using historical and current data from the data set [`teams.csv`](https://github.com/sanchitsanyam/ML-projects/blob/main/teams%20(1).csv): using machine learning algorithms

## Project Steps
The project follows these steps:

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.

## Files
- [`machine_learning.ipynb`](https://github.com/sanchitsanyam/ML-projects/blob/main/Olympic_medal_prediction%20(1).ipynb): The main project code.
- [`data_prep.ipynb`](https://github.com/sanchitsanyam/ML-projects/blob/main/data_prep.ipynb): Code to generate the team-level dataset from an athlete-level dataset.
- [`teams.csv`](https://github.com/sanchitsanyam/ML-projects/blob/main/teams%20(1).csv): The team-level data used in this project.


## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
To set up the project locally, install the following Python packages:







## Usage

### Running the Project
1. Open `data_prep.ipynb` and run all cells to generate the team-level dataset.
2. Open `machine_learning.ipynb` and follow the steps to build and evaluate the model.

### Hypothesis
We hypothesize that the number of medals won by a country can be predicted using historical and socio-economic data.

### Data Exploration and Preparation
- Explore the data to understand its structure and content.
- Reshape the athlete-level data to a team-level dataset for our predictions.

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values.
- Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.

### Model Training
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Train a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree).
- Evaluate the model using an appropriate error metric.
